# Golang in London - Music Player

Hello and welcome to the first, live-coding session with Golang in London!

Today we'll build a simple music player in the terminal, using amazing [beep](github.com/faiface/beep) library. And, of course, all using Go!

If you will ever get lost or will want to redo the whole workshop alone - follow the tutorial below. Also, use [CHEAT.md] if you need a reference to basics of Go. Let's roll!
