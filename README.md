# Golang in London - Music Player

Hello and welcome to the first, live-coding session with Golang in London!

Today we'll build a simple music player in the terminal, using amazing [beep](github.com/faiface/beep) library. And, of course, all using Go!

If you will ever get lost or will want to redo the whole workshop alone - follow the tutorial below. Also, use [CHEAT.md] if you need a reference to basics of Go. Let's roll!

## Intro

If you're here, you most probably know what Go is and why we use it. In case you need a refresher:

**Go** (or known also as **golang** - because of it's web domain) is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson. Released in late 2009, it took the programming scene by a storm.

Why **Go** you might ask?

* Language spec for Go is 50 pages - where Java's is around 770 pages;
* Genius standard library that allows to create production-ready apps out-of-the-box
* Extremely well designed concurrency using *goroutines*
* Garbage collection optimized for low latency
* Great documentation
* Excellent tooling, again, out-of-the-box
* Fast compile times
* Very stable library, with a strict compatibility promise that all Go 1 programs will run unchanged on later versions of Go 1.x
* Heavily used in cloud tools - from Docker to Dropbox
* Very desired - according to StackOverflow's 2019 survey, it's the third most wanted programming language
